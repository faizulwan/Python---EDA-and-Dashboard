 A luscious- long-wearing powder eyeshadow. 

What it does:
This creamy shadow glides on in one smooth stroke for long-wearing color- and is formulated to be crease and fade resistant. It is available in soft matte- soft shimmer- or super shimmer finish. Matte finish shadows give fine lines and wrinkles a softer- smoother look. A hint of soft shimmer shadow dabbed into the center of lids adds a pop of brightness. Super shimmer shadows act as highlighting shades to bring out browbones and inner corners of eyes. Try light shades for a more dramatic effect on deeper skintones or dark shades for a more natural look. Dark shades look more dramatic on fairer skins; light ones look more natural.

Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent.

Radiant top notes burst with the juicy freshness of Calabrian bergamot- while amberwood unleashes a powerfully woody trail. Sauvage is a fragrance inspired by wide-open spaces under a blue sky that dominates a white-hot desert landscape.  About the Bottle: The pure- pared-down bottle features a signature Dior design- each detail carefully studied. It is a luxurious object resulting from years of technical research and development.About the Fragrance: ""To create Sauvage- I used man as my starting point. A strong and unmistakable masculinity. Like the image of a man who transcends time and fashion.""—François Demachy- Dior Perfumer-Creator",Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,unknown,0,0,0,0

It is a luxurious object resulting from years of technical research and development.,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,unknown,0,0,0,0

Vibrant and lively- the rose notes exude an irresistible scent that immediately transports us to a field of flowers. The abundance of Grasse and Damascus rose notes are brightened by a note of bergamot zest.About the Bottle: The iconic Miss Dior bottle is inspired by men's and women's couture. The houndstooth motif engraved in the precious glass recalls menswear- while the signature Miss Dior bow evokes elegant femininity.  ,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,Alcohol- Parfum (Fragrance)- Aqua (Water)- Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate- Limonene- Hydroxycitronellal- Linalool- Citronellol- Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane- Ethylhexyl Salicylate- Geraniol- Triethyl Citrate- Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl- Hydroxyhydrocinnamate- Coumarin- Citral- Benzyl Alcohol- Eugenol- Bht- Ci 17200 (Red 33)- Ci 19140 (Yellow 5)- Ci 60730 (Ext.

Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,unknown,0,1,0,0

If you want to know more…Thanks to the microencapsulated mattifying Smart Pore Control™—microcapsules of zinc gluconate that visibly reducing the production of sebum and targets the oilier areas of the skin—skin is instantly softer and more even. Day after day- it improves the appearance of pores and spots- revealing perfectly refined- even skin.   
What else you need to know:The exceptional brightening power of the Edelweiss from Dior Gardens. Skin evenness and color are determined by a pigment known as melanin. With aging and repeated sunlight exposure- the undesirable sallow color of melanin spreads all over the skin- altering its evenness. Over time- melanin also becomes darker- damaging the natural skin color. Dior researchers have discovered that Edelweiss extract from the Dior Gardens in Switzerland interferes in this process and can diminish- correct- and prevent the creation of dark spots. Preventive action against spots is one of the most effective ways to achieve lasting efficacy on skin evenness and color correction.Edelweiss is cultivated at the heart of the Valais Garden in Switzerland at an altitude of 1-100 m. In this beautiful but hostile environment- temperatures can drop until -10°C while UV intensity is extreme- heavily reflected by the eternal snows. All the conditions are gathered for Edelweiss to develop the finest flowers- naturally and in the greatest respect of the environment

Infrared light gently penetrates your hair- drawing out the oils inside the hair shaft to sit on the surface- thus helping to maximize shine- decrease drying time- lock in moisture- and reduce damage. The 100 percent ceramic interior surface produces negative ions when heated. These ions attach to undesirable particles in your hair- cleaning the strands and reducing frizz and static while you style. Negative ions also break apart water molecules quickly which reduces drying time. This ultra-quiet and lightweight dryer comes with a 10-foot cord.                                                                                      ,Suggested Usage:-Plug the dryer into an electrical outlet and switch the power button to one of the two speed modes.   -Select the heat setting that is most suitable for your hair type.-When styling is complete- turn the dryer off by moving the power switch to the off position and unplug from the wall.

-For the most intense strobing effect- layer each shade underneath its coordinating Amazonian clay 12-hour powder highlighter.

This product is an Allure Best of Beauty award winner.",Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,unknown,0,0,0,0

Sharp and pristine- the piercing prickles of the stems hook onto each other- bonding their blooms in pink perfection. A rose by any other name wouldn’t be TOM FORD.,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent.

Fragrance Description: Brilliant. Lavish. Refined. Velvet Orchid is a fragrance that lives in the black orchid world of glamorous mystique- sharing its aura yet standing apart with its own compelling identity. It pushes the D.N.A. of the original Black Orchid into new territory- evolving hidden facets of the original's olfactive structure with extravagant ingredients to reveal even more brilliance- femininity- and attractive force. 
About the Fragrance: In Velvet Orchid- the daring and dramatic floral signature of black orchid is the inspiration for a warm and enveloping fragrance that is lavished with shimmering freshness- dramatic petals- honey- and rum. The woods and spices of the original scent recede and a contrasting veil of petally floralcy casts a shadow of ultra-femininity throughout. A new character emerges: one that pulls rather than pushes; and that is more harmonious than mysterious—elegantly refined and polished. Velvet Orchid has an addicting beauty that seduces with a fluid and textured touch. It is the rippling black silk next to black orchid's sleek marble. Velvet Orchid masterfully embellishes and evolves the Black Orchid legacy.  
""To this day- velvet is my favorite fabric. The woman who wears this is not a wildflower. She’s an urban flower- she’s a hothouse flower- she’s an orchid.""—Tom Ford

Evoking the private exchanges and insider moments where fantasies come true- the scent can only be described in one way.About the Fragrance: With a name that says it all- the vibrant opening makes an instant statement as clary sage and fresh lavender command attention with aromatic foreplay. Delectable bitter almond and vanilla inflections infuse textural richness to the leather heart. Drenched in orris root from the iris flower- the full- luscious body of the supple Italian plonge reveals its exquisite beauty. Addictive tonka bean and lavish leather drive the scent as amber undertones reverberate with a warm glow. Ultra-fine blonde woods create a confident expression of pure luxury with a creamy finish.,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,unknown,0,0,0,0

Scent Type: Earthy Greens & Herbs

Key Notes: French Lavender- Italian Bergamot- Tonka Bean

Fragrance Description: An element pushed to the extreme- two distinct lavenders merge from the start. Lavender from the Hautes-Alpes region of Provence grows in the high mountains and pulses with adrenaline-pumping freshness. Lavender in the valley dries for three days- allowing the lavender oil to develop its unique character with amber-like facets. Vibrant Italian Bergamot drenches the herbaceous open with citrus.

At the heart- daucus carota—transformed through an exclusive enzyme process—eradicates earthiness and amplifies the fresher expression and orris qualities. A third pure lavender propels Lavender Extrême beyond all expectations. Lavender Absolute France punches up a balsamic core with green undertones.

The oriental dimension at the finish builds on the warm glow of wild-grown Tonka Bean. Sourced in Laos- the creamy wood effect of Benzoin hooks with a final dose of Extrême’s charismatic audacity- potent and excessively luxurious.


About the Fragrance: ""Lavender Extrême is fresh- divergent- and stimulating. Lavender is reworked and refracted to become something irreverently new—a stunning- electric creation to be worn at maximum volume.”—TOM FORD

","Suggested Usage:
-On clean skin- spray fragrance once or twice on desired areas. Do not rub the fragrance on skin- as this will alter how the fragrance develops.

Pro-Tip: Layer your fragrance with Body Moisturizer for a more sensorial experience.

Key Notes: Sicilian Lemon- Bigarade Leaf Absolute- Violet Leaf Absolute Orpur- White Acacia Accord- Jasmine Grandiforum Concrete- Acacia Honey Accord
Fragrance Description: Private blend Fleur de Portofino is inspired by the cascades of white flowers that spill off the branches of the white acacia- a beloved shade tree that dots the Mediterranean's gardens and lines its tranquil avenues. Fleur de Portofino creates a crisp and bright floral accord from this bloom- and then surrounds it with effervescent citruses and acacia honey. The fragrance creates an effect of sheer floral possession that is incomparably hypnotic and extremely bold.
""Fleur de Portofino perfectly embodies the private side of Portofino- a floral seduction- a sort of discretion in its approach to hypnotizing you- taking you in with knowing confidence.""—Tom Ford",Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil.

","Suggested usage:
-Although this is a moderately fast-drying cleaner- to speed up the drying time- use an absorbent material such as terry cloth or paper towel to blot and soak up all the moisture.

-Reshape the bristles of the brush and lay it flat or at a downward angle to dry.

 Precautions:
-Make sure all containers are tightly sealed when not in use to reduce evaporation.
